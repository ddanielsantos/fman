## fman

My workflow revolves around the Helix editor, I needed a simple file manager to integrate with it, I had already tried both broot and lf, but neither seemed simple enough, I couldn't test nnn because it wasn't available on Windows, my options were to wait for the Helix plugin system or create my own application.

I was heavily inspired by lazygit/docker, two tools that I use a lot and that are practically no-brainer to use, I wanted that level of ease of use for fman.
