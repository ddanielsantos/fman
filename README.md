## fman

My workflow revolves around the [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) editor, I needed a simple file manager to integrate with it, I had already tried both broot and lf, but neither seemed simple enough, I couldn't test nnn because it wasn't available on Windows, my options were to wait for the Helix plugin system or create my own application.

I was heavily inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)/[docker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), two tools that I use a lot and that are practically no-brainer to use, I wanted that level of ease of use for fman.
